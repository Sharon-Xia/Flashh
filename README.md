## Flashcard App (Flashh)

## Lab 3

### App Description
The flashcard app now saves cards created, and allows you to switch between them. 
The next button switches the displayed card to a random card in the database, and grays out when there's less than 2 cards in the database. 
The trash button deletes the current card from the database, and switches the displayed card to a random card. The trash button also grays out whenever there are no cards left to be deleted.
If there are no cards currently in the database, the app prompts the user to add a card.
All functions from the previous labs are still supported.

Lastly, the layout was updated to be more aesthetic :).
